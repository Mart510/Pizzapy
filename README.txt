PizzaPy Terminal project
==============================	

As part of CodeAcademys python course I needed to create a python program that allowed a user to interact with it using the Terminal.

PizzaPy is a pizza shop that runs on a terminal interface. You can order one of 4 special pizza's in any size. You can also order a custom pizza with up to four toppings.

When the order is compelte it returns the order and the total price for the user.

This project contains several files in order to work.

PizzaPy.py contains all of the main functions PizzaMaker.py contains all of the Pizza class instructions and methods Menu.py contains the ASCII menu
